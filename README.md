# üåç United Nations Data Analysis

This project explores and cleans socioeconomic data from the **United Nations** using SQL and Python. It focuses on understanding population distribution, access to basic services, and regional unemployment statistics. The analysis is performed on a **MySQL** database connected via **SQLAlchemy** and visualized in a Jupyter Notebook.
